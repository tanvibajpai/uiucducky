    <center><h1>Rubber Duck Preservation Society</h1></center>
    <center><p>Since the dawn of Computing, Rubber Ducks have been the Computer Scientists' trusted debugging and algorithm design companion. In recent years, these loyal birds have been replaced with technological gadgetry and websites like StackOverflow, GeeksForGeeks, or LeetCode. Even more recently, Rubber Ducks are being hunted in the name of Extra Credit.</p></center>
    <center><p>It is the goal of the Rubber Duck Preservation Society to reinstate the honor and prestige of the noble Rubber Ducks. If you find one of our ducks, please give it a good home in your workplace. If you are not currently in need of a rubber duck, give it to a friend, or leave it somewhere in Siebel for someone else to adopt.</p></center>
